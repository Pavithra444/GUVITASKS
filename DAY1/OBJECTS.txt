OBJECTS
*******
      * In javascript everything treated as an object.
      * Object is a collection of key-value pairs.
      * Object is one of the advanced datatype.
      * javascript automatically allocates the memory when objects are created.

SYNTAX:
*******
        Syntax for creating an object

        datatype objectname ={
            key1:value1,
            key2:value2,
            .
            .
            .
            keyn:value
        };

  datatype---- type of the object;
  objectname---- name of the object;
  key1...keyn-----name of the keys;(like variable names);
  value1...valuen----initialing the values to the keys;

  ':' - We have to use colon symbol to assign values to keys inside of object definition part.
  ',' - We have to use comma symbol to seperate the key value pairs. 

    There is one another method,using new keyword we can also create an object

        var objectname=new Object();    

        var---- datatype;
        objectname---- name of the object;
        new---- keyword;
        Object()----it is a constructor;

EXAMPLE:
*******     
      var data={
        name:"Pavithra",
        course:"FSD"
      };

ASSIGNMENT:
***********
            We can assign values to the keys in the creation phase itself,or else we can assign values to the keys
            out of object definition part.

          example: data.name="Pavithra Balakrishnan";
RE-ASSIGNMENT:
*************
            We can also reassign the values for keys anywhere in the program.

           example: data.course="DATA SCIENCE"; 

ACCESSING:
**********
            We can access the keys in two ways.Those are
                * Using '.' dot operator.
                * Using square brackets[].

        We can access the keys using dot operator.
        example: data.name;
        We can access the keys using [] square brackets.
        example: data[name];

Creating Keys:
-------------
            We can create keys in the creation phase itself,or else we can create the keys
out of object definition part.
Syntax for creating keys out of definition phase:

           objectname.keyname="value";

           objectname[keyname]="value";

Example:
       data.batch="FSD60WE-T";

       data[batch]="FSD60WE-T";

METHODS:
*******
        Objects are not only a key-value pairs,it can also contain functions,those are called 
        object methods.

DELETING THE OBJECT:
*******************
        We can delete the object using 'delete' keyword.Once the object is deleted the memory frees the space.
Syntax:
        delete objectname;

        delete----keyword;
        objectname---- name of the object;
example:

        delete data;
