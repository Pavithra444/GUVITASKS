HTTP1
*****
    * Http stands for "HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL"
    * This protocal used to transfer data across the web.

Text-Based Protocol: 
                    The plain text is exchanged over client and the server.That is why it is called
as text-based protocol.The messge contains two parts.The first one is header and the second one is body.The header 
part is must,the body part is optional.The message may be a request message or response message.

State-Less Protocol:
                     Requests from client to server are not depends on another one.Each request are independent.
                     Server does not contain old information about the client who is approching again.
                     To maintain the state it requires additional mechanisms when multiple requests occur.

Request-Response Model:
                    In this model client used to send request to the server.The server respond to the client
baesd on the message.This request have methods like

                    *GET
                    *POST
                    *PUT
                    *DELETE

          Header Fields:
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                    The header field includes meta data about the message.It may like content length,content type,
                    cache control directives,cookies.          

DISADVANTAGES:
*************
            Each request and response needs seperate TCP connection.
            it slow downs the efficiancy.
            When loading multiple resources, leades to higher connection rate.
            Inefficiant "Header-Handling" when multiple connections occur.

HTTP2
*****
        This HTTP2 is the second major version of HTTP1.It is also used to transfer data across the web.

Binary Protocol:
        Where HTTP1 is a text-based protocol but HTTP2 is a binary protocol.This gives more efficiency in parsing and transmission of data.

Multiplexing:
        This feature is the main key of http2.This allows multiple requests and responses over a single connection.
        The main things is they are done in a parallel manner.

        ADVANTAGE:
        **********
                This multiplexing feature eliminates the nedd for multiple TCP connections,it is efficient 
                when multiple resources are using in a website.it decreses the latency and improves the performance.
Header Compression:
        This feature compress the header fields,before sending them in the network 

Server Push:
        This featues enables the server to send the data to client without receiving any request message from the
        client.This become clients to easy access on the data.

Stream Prioritization:         
        In http2 it has the information about the priority.It helps in resource allocation.

Backward Compatibility:
        It is fully compatible with HTTP1.So there is no need to change the existing web infrastructure.


DIFFERENCES:
    HTTP1 
    *****
    Text Based.     No Multiplexing . No Header Compression.  No Server Push.
    HTTP2 
    ******
    Binary Based.   Multiplexing    . Header Compression.     Server Push.


    Because of the new features of HTTP2 becomes faster and advanced.
